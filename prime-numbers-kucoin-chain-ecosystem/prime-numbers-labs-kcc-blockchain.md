Prime Numbers Labs, a blockchain-focused organization known for its pioneering work in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the XDC Network, is set to launch its technology on the Kucoin Blockchain. This technology will be used to build NFTs that can be utilized for hosting NODES.

In addition, the Kucoin blockchain will be implemented on Primeport and Prime Numbers Finance, two of Prime Numbers Labs' innovative platforms.

With the implementation of the Primeport NFT marketplace on the Kucoin chain, the quality of the KCC chain marketplaces will be boosted. This will offer the Kucoin community the possibilities that Primeport offers, including the ability to create NFT collections and own the smart contract of their collections.

Prime Numbers Labs has developed several innovative platforms, including Prime Numbers XDC, a multifaceted ecosystem that generates revenue through its DeFi and NFT protocols.
