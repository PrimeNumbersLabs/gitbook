# What is Prime Port?

PrimePort is a multichain NFT marketplace currently deployed on the XDC Network. It supports the creation and trading of NFT collections along with staking information for the Prime Numbers Labs NFT Staking System. PrimePort will be deployed on the EVM networks where the PRNT NFTs will be.

PrimePort is the first NFT Marketplace on the XDC Blockchain. It has a user-friendly interface, and a portion of the secondary sales are distributed to our NFT holders. We created it as a place to trade our NFTs.&#x20;
