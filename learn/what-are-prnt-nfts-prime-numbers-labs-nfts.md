# What are PRNT NFTs (Prime Numbers Labs NFTs)?

PRNT Staking NFTs are the first utility NFT collection released by Prime Numbers Labs. This collection is central to our ecosystem and offers unique advantages, including economic benefits and a share of the ecosystem fees.

PRNT Staking NFTs possess unique qualities and characteristics. They are the nexus connecting the entire Prime Numbers Labs ecosystem on any network. They offer numerous advantages and user experiences that a regular user does not have, including a system that allows you to stake inside the NFT and earn rewards. A portion of the fees generated by the Prime Numbers ecosystem are shared out between holders of the PRNT Staking NFTs.&#x20;
