# WHAT IS PRIME NUMBERS?

## Our Vision

Prime Numbers is a project that sells NFTs to give scholarships to students.

However, It is much more than that. You could find an ecosystem based on art, students and NFTs.

If you are a student, you would gain profits from the scholarships and our discord´s group, where you are ought to share your projects and to look for a mate.

If you are a developing artist, you could exhibit your work and catch people´s attention and recognition.

In case you are a collector, you would have available NFTs made by the team and the artwork of other artists in the community.
