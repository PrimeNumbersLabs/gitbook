# WHAT IS PRIME NUMBERS?

**Prime Numbers** is a DAO that **generates funds** for our **community and students** through **NFTs and DEFI.**

**Prime Numbers are composed of** [**Prime Numbers DAO**](https://www.primenumbers.es/) **&** [**Prime Numbers Finance**](https://www.primenumbers.finance/)**.**\
****\
****Basically, Prime Numbers have [different mechanisms](https://medium.com/@PrimeNumbersFi/prime-numbers-reward-system-e097aeb7187c) to generate funds for the community. For example:\
\
\- Staking tokens inside NFTs\
\- Royalties from our NFT collection.\
\- Fees from our NFT marketplace.\
\- 40% of the profits from our lending and borrowing protocol Prime Numbers Finance.

However, It is much more than that. You could find an ecosystem based on DEFI and NFTs.



Prime Numbers is the first DAO, the first NFT project and the first Lending and Borrowing protocol on the XDC Network.
