# WHAT IS THE PRIME NUMBERS XDC ECOSYSTEM?

Prime Numbers XDC is an ecosystem composed of different DEFI and NFT protocols that generate revenue for its community on the XDC Blockchain.

Our ecosystem generates revenue through the fees created by Prime Finance, the first lending and borrowing protocol on XDC.

We reward our community through our NFTs collections, which have a [revolutionary staking system](https://medium.com/@PrimeNumbersFi/nft-staking-mechanics-june-update-8d3eb8327258) where you stake tokens inside your NFTs to earn rewards.

### **PRNT NFTS**

Our ecosystem is based on our NFT collection, where you stake PRNT tokens inside the NFTS to get rewards from the fees of all our protocols.



First lending and borrowing platform in the XDC network for cryptocurrency and NFTs. Part of the revenue from this protocol will go to PRNT NFT & XDC Staking NFT holders.
