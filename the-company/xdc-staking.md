## Introduction <a href="#5919" id="5919"></a>

**XDC STAKING NFTs is an NFT collection with a high utility.**

**First non-custodial and trustless $XDC staking.**

**These NFTs are like “vaults” where you put your XDC.**

Welcome to the explanatory post about how NFTs and XDC staking will work.

The collection consists of 5557 NFTs, of which 5542 are made by Prime Numbers, and 15 have the same aspect as the Prime Numbers Handmade NFTs.

## Staking system with NFTs <a href="#6c54" id="6c54"></a>

We present to you our revolutionary staking system featuring NFTs.

In order to earn rewards with XDC Staking NFTs, you will need to stake your $XDC. This does not happen in an ordinary way however, when we stake at the Prime Numbers ecosystem, we stake inside the NFTs. This means your staked tokens will give an intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT by “Empty NFT” or “BurnToRedeem”.

When we stake our tokens in the NFT, they will gradually level up. You will able to stake as much as you want until the max limit \[100,000 $XDC per NFT]\(Not the final amount, still in development).

Your share depends on the multiplier of your NFT which is based on both its level(added multiplier) and its rarity(base multiplier).

The higher your level and the more rarity you have the more reward you will get.

These NFTs upon receiving the tokens will level up from this. The staking airdrop will be factored in based on the amount of $XDC inside the NFT.

## Total Multipliers <a href="#75d4" id="75d4"></a>

Depending on your Base Rarity and/or level you will get a Total Multiplier.\
Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier

Example:

NFT with Base Multiplier 2.0 and level 18 (added multiplier 1.8) will be a total multiplier of 3.8

**Minting Details:**

THE FIRST WAVE SOLD OUT!!!

THE SECOND MINTING WAVE WILL BE ON 17TH NOVEMBER AT 17:05 PM CET

THE THIRD MINTING WAVE WILL BE ON 1ST DECEMBER AT 17:05 PM CET

THE FOURTH MINTING WAVE WILL BE ON 15TH DECEMBER AT 17:05 PM CET

BETWEEN MINTING WAVES WE WILL RELEASE SIMULATIONS AND MORE INFORMATION! STAY TUNED FOR MORE INFO.

THE REVEAL WILL BE JUST AFTER THE LAST WAVE.

We are going to do the minting in different waves with different prices.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1_4fS5w1Be-JsQ1U2wDlG9Aw (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We will sell 5300 NFTs in the minting waves.

31 NFTs will be airdropped to the PRNT NFTs Plentiful holders.\
15 NFTs will be airdropped to the PRNT NFTs Handmade holders.\
1 NFT will be airdropped to the PRNT NFTs Godly Holder.

210 NFTs will be minted for development purposes + marketing.

## **Rewards:** <a href="#7242" id="7242"></a>

These NFTs are going to get the following rewards:

* 10% of Prime Numbers Finance Profits
* In the first two years, 30% of the funds from the minting will be rewarded to the XDC Staking NFTs.

We will give the 30% of the funds from the minting because Prime Numbers Finance is not finished(will be in February) and we want to start giving rewards.

The 10% of Prime Numbers Finance profits should be higher than the 33% of the minting funds.\
All of these rewards will be paid on $XDC.

## 1- Fixed Reward <a href="#164e" id="164e"></a>

**30% of the minting funds will be rewarded to the NFTs in the first two years. After these first two years, the reward for the non-locked and non-custodial $XDC staking will be 10% of the profits from Prime Numbers Finance.**

**Formula Staking:** a= total multiplier of the NFT

a = x +y

x= base multiplier \[multiplier per rarity of the NFT]

y= added multiplier \[multiplier per level of the NFT]

**We have found a way to make the rewards fair for everyone:**

b= $XDC staked per NFT

15% of the minting given to “a” -> \[Total Multiplier] of the NFTs

15% of the minting given to (“a” \* ”b”) -> \[(Total Multiplier)\*Tokens)]

## Frequently Asked Questions <a href="#e4a3" id="e4a3"></a>

* **When the staking rewards are sent?**\
  Smart-contract send the rewards on the last day of every month.
* **When a person is in the process of leveling up and a rewards drop takes place. Since the rewards drop into the NFT, does that help increase the levels?**\
  Yes.

## Staking Interface Buttons <a href="#c8fe" id="c8fe"></a>

* **“Staking” Button**\
  This button is used for stake inside the NFT.
* **“Transfer” Button**\
  This button is used for transferring NFTs between wallets.
* **“Empty NFT” Button**\
  This button takes out the NFT balance.\
  To use this button you need the NFT without interactions the previous 15 days of trying to use “**Empty NFT**”.\
  Interaction = Transfer, Stake
* **“GetSurplus” Button**\
  This button takes out the NFT balance above 82980 $XDC.\
  To use this button you need the NFT without interactions the previous 15 days of trying to use “GetSurplus”.\
  Interaction = Transfer, Stake
* **“BurnToRedeem” Button**\
  This button breaks the NFT and takes out all the $XDC inside the NFT.\

## Summary <a href="#f268" id="f268"></a>

After reading the entire post we can get the following conclusions:

Due to our level system, it can be very interesting and rewarding to try to achieve the highest level. Just by actively leveling your NFT you quickly raise in reward multiplier, resulting in a larger slice of the $XDC pie.

Depending on the rarity of the NFT and its level, you can get up to +4x in the rewards.
