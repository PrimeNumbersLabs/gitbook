#### Introduction

**XDC STAKING NFTs is an NFT collection with a high utility.**

**First non-custodial and trustless $XDC staking.**

**These NFTs are like "vaults" where you put your XDC.**

Welcome to the explanatory post about how NFTs and XDC staking will work.

The collection consists of 5557 NFTs, of which Prime Numbers make 5542, and 15 have the same aspect as the Prime Numbers Handmade NFTs.

**New "MERGE SYSTEM" and "REFUND SYSTEM"**

#### Rewards:

These NFTs are going to get the following rewards:

* **VARIABLE REWARD:** 10% of Prime Numbers Finance Profits
* **FIXED REWARD:** In the first two years, 30% of the funds from the minting will be rewarded to the XDC Staking NFTs.

We will give the 30% of the funds from the minting because Prime Numbers Finance (Lending and Borrowing Protocol) development is ongoing, and we want to start giving rewards.

The 10% of Prime Numbers Finance profits should be higher than the 30% of the minting funds.\
All of these rewards will be paid on $XDC.

#### 1- Fixed Reward

**30% of the minting funds will be rewarded to the NFTs in the first two years. After these first two years, the non-locked and non-custodial $XDC staking reward will be 10% of the profits from Prime Numbers Finance.**

**PAYOUT Formula Staking**\
a= total Multiplier of the NFT\
a = x +y\
x= base multiplier \[Multiplier per rarity of the NFT]\
y= added Multiplier \[Multiplier per level of the NFT]

**We have found a way to make the rewards fair for everyone:**\
b= XDC staked per NFT

HALF XDC REWARD given to "a" -> \[Total Multiplier] of the NFTs\
HALF XDC REWARD given to (“a” \* ”b”) -> \[(Total Multiplier)\*XDC)]

#### 2- Prime Numbers Finance

Prime Numbers XDC Staking NFTs will receive 10% of [Prime Numbers Finance](https://primenumberswhitepaper.gitbook.io/prime-numbers/the-company/prime-numbers-finance) profits.

#### XDC NFT Staking (optional):

When your NFT reaches the **MAX LIMIT** (**100 000 $XDC** staked inside the NFT), you will be able to lock this NFT to get an **additional 7% APY**

The lock period will be **one year.**\
**The XDC inside this NFT is used to host masternodes.**

**The reward will be paid monthly to the NFT.**

Example: You have an NFT with 100 000 $XDC. And you lock it.\
From the lock, you get 7% of 100 000 $XDC -> 7000 $XDC\
And a part of the 10% of Prime Numbers Finance profits and an amount of the 30% minting funds.

#### Different Rarities:

#### Prime Numbers Handmade NFTs

The first 15 Prime Numbers consist of handcrafted images from our Art Director.

The owners of these Prime Numbers Handmade NFTs will get 3 XDC Staking NFTs for free.

Base Multiplier = 2.

#### **MERGE SYSTEM**

We are happy to show you how our merge NFTs system works.

**You can merge 2 NFTs of the same rarity to get one of the following rarities.**

Examples: \
The merge of **2 common NFTs** will make **one uncommon NFT.**\
The merge of **2 mythic NFTs** will make **one godly NFT.**

**Godly** is the best rarity you can get using the **merge system**.

When you merge 2 NFTs, these 2 NFTs get burned, and you get 1 NFT of the next rarity.

This makes the NFTs deflationary.

#### Refund System

Here we show you how our merge NFTs system works.

**You can use the "BurnToRedeem" button to get 30 $PRNT (Refund System)**

This button breaks the NFT and extracts all the $XDC inside the NFT.\
It cannot be reversed; it will burn your NFT and send all the XDC to your wallet. Also, you get 30 $PRNT when you break the NFT.

Examples: \
1- If you test and don't like how the staking system or rewards work, you can decide to "BurnToRedeem" the NFT to get 30 $PRNT.

2- You minted and got one low rarity, and you prefer 30 $PRNT; you can also use this system.

3- The 30 $PRNT is more valuable than the NFT, and you decide to "BurnToRedeem" as an investment option.

This makes the NFTs deflationary.

#### The staking system with NFTs

We present to you our revolutionary staking system featuring NFTs.

To earn rewards with XDC Staking NFTs, you must stake your $XDC. This does not happen in an ordinary way; however, when we stake at the Prime Numbers ecosystem, we stake inside the NFTs. This means your staked tokens will give an intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT by "Empty NFT," "Withdraw XDC," or "BurnToRedeem."

When we stake our tokens in the NFT, they will gradually level up. You will be able to stake as much as you want until the max limit \[100 000 $XDC per NFT]

Your share depends on the Multiplier of your NFT, which is based on both its level(added Multiplier) and its rarity(base multiplier).

The higher your level and the more rarity you have, the more reward you will get.

These NFTs, upon receiving the tokens, will level up from this. The staking airdrop will be factored in based on the amount of $XDC inside the NFT.

**Max limit \[100 000 $XDC per NFT]**\
**100 000 $XDC is the max amount you can stake, but the NFT XDC balance can go above 100 000 $XDC due de rewards.**

#### The information you can see in the staking interface:

**Type**: X

**Attributes**\
Global rarity: \
Global rarity name: \
Base multiplier:

**Staking**\

Total Staked $XDC: \
Total Rewarded $XDC:\
Level:\

Last Stake Time:\
Last Month's Reward:\
Added Multiplier:\

Total Multiplier:\

#### Total Multipliers

Depending on your Base Rarity and/or level, you will get a Total Multiplier.\
Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier

Example:

NFT with Base Multiplier 2.0 and level 18 (added multiplier 1.8) will be a total multiplier of 3.8

#### How to stake?

The tutorial is coming!

#### Frequently Asked Questions

* **When are the staking rewards sent?**\
  Smart-contract sends the rewards on the last day of every month.
* **When a person is in the process of leveling up, and a rewards drop occurs. Since the rewards drop into the NFT, does that help increase the levels?**\
  Yes. But you need to stake to advance to the next level!

#### Staking Interface Buttons

* **"Stake" Button**\
  This button is used for stake inside the NFT.
* **"Transfer" Button**\
  This button is used for transferring NFTs between wallets.
* **"WITHDRAW XDC" Button**\
  This button takes out the NFT balance.\
  To use this button, you need the NFT without interactions the previous seven days before using **"WITHDRAW XDC."**\
  Interaction = Transfer, Stake
* **"BurnToRedeem" Button**\
  This button breaks the NFT and extracts all the $XDC inside the NFT.\
  **It cannot be reversed;** it will burn your NFT and send all the XDC to your wallet. Also, **you get 30 $PRNT when you break the NFT.**
* **"Merge NFTs" Button**\
  This button **merges 2 NFTs of the same rarity to get one of the following rarities.**
* **"LOCK NFT" Button**\
  This button locks this NFT for one year and one month to get an **additional 7% APY.**\
  When your NFT reaches the **MAX LIMIT** (**100 000 $XDC** staked inside the NFT), you will be able to lock this NFT to get this reward.\
  **NFTs that are locked cannot utilize BurnToRedeem, Merge NFTs, or WithdrawXDC features.**

#### Summary

After reading the entire post, we can get the following conclusions:

Due to our level system, trying to achieve the highest level can be very interesting and rewarding. By actively leveling your NFT, you quickly raise in reward multiplier, resulting in a larger slice of the $XDC pie.

Depending on the rarity of the NFT and level, you can get up to +4x in the rewards.
