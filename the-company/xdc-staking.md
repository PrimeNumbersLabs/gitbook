## Staking system with NFTs <a href="#6c54" id="6c54"></a>

We present to you our revolutionary staking system featuring NFTs.

In order to earn rewards with XDC Staking NFTs, you will need to stake your $XDC. This does not happen in an ordinary way however, when we stake at the Prime Numbers ecosystem, we stake inside the NFTs. This means your staked tokens will give an intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT by “Empty NFT” or “BurnToRedeem”.

When we stake our tokens in the NFT, they will gradually level up. There is a maximum potency that we can stake on a daily basis, so we have to repeat this process on a regular basis, not more than once a day.

Your share depends on the multiplier of your NFT which is based on both its level(added multiplier) and its rarity(base multiplier).

The higher your level and the more rarity you have the more reward you will get.

These NFTs upon receiving the tokens will level up from this. The staking airdrop will be factored in based on the amount of $XDC inside the NFT.

## Total Multipliers <a href="#75d4" id="75d4"></a>

Depending on your Base Rarity and/or level you will get a Total Multiplier.\
Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier

Example:

NFT with Base Multiplier 2.0 and level 18 (added multiplier 1.8) will be a total multiplier of 3.8

## **Rewards** <a href="#7242" id="7242"></a>

These NFTs are going to get the following rewards:

* 10% of Prime Numbers Finance Profits
* In the first two years, 33% of the funds from the minting will be rewarded to the XDC Staking NFTs.

We will give the 33% of the funds from the minting because Prime Numbers Finance is not finished(will be in February) and we want to start giving rewards.

The 10% of Prime Numbers Finance profits should be higher than the 33% of the minting funds.\
All of these rewards will be paid on $XDC.

## Important Data: <a href="#ed02" id="ed02"></a>

MAX Number of NFTs: 5557

We will need a soft cap of 1500 NFTs sold! If we don't get this, we will refund all the NFTs.

Price x NFT: 2500 $XDC ($75 ) (The final price will be chosen two weeks before the minting)

XDC staking will be released few weeks after Primeport release.

## How to stake? <a href="#2018" id="2018"></a>

The tutorial will come after the minting.

## Frequently Asked Questions <a href="#e4a3" id="e4a3"></a>

* **When the staking rewards are sent?**\
  Smart-contract send the rewards on the last day of every month.
* **When a person is in the process of leveling up and a rewards drop takes place. Since the rewards drop into the NFT, does that help increase the levels?**\
  Yes.

## Staking Interface Buttons <a href="#c8fe" id="c8fe"></a>

* **“Staking” Button**\
  This button is used for stake inside the NFT. This button follows the staking rules. Sometimes you will need a lower amount of the daily max allowed because you need less $XDC to level up your NFT.
* **“Transfer” Button**\
  This button is used for transferring NFTs between wallets.
* **“Instant Stake” Button**\
  This button allows you to stake whatever you want amount but you pay a 5% fee of the introduced amount. If you introduce 10000 $XDC -> 9500$ XDC to the stake and 500$ XDC for the fee.
* **“Empty NFT” Button**\
  This button takes out the NFT balance.\
  To use this button you need the NFT without interactions the previous 15 days of trying to use “**Empty NFT**”.\
  Interaction = Transfer, Stake
* **“BurnToRedeem” Button**\
  This button breaks the NFT and takes out all the $XDC inside the NFT.\
  It cannot be reversed, it will burn your NFT and send all the XDC to your wallet.

## Summary <a href="#f268" id="f268"></a>

After reading the entire post we can get the following conclusions:

Due to our level system, it can be very interesting and rewarding to try to achieve the highest level. Just by actively leveling your NFT you quickly raise in reward multiplier, resulting in a larger slice of the $XDC pie.

Depending on the rarity of the NFT and its level, you can get up to +4x in the rewards.
