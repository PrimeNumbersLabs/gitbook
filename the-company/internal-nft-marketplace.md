You can check the NFT marketplace:&#x20;

or\
[primenumbers.market](http://primenumbers.market/)

This NFT marketplace interface is only for Prime Numbers NFTs but also we have ready the smart contracts for the general NFT market.

This NFT marketplace interface has different filters to make your “shopping” easier. You can also check the not listed NFTs.

This smart contract is the same smart contract as OpenSea (SeaPort) so you can imagine the quality of the smart contract.

You can check the smart contract: [https://xdc.blocksscan.io/address/xdc00000000006c3852cbef3e08e8df289169ede581](https://xdc.blocksscan.io/address/xdc00000000006c3852cbef3e08e8df289169ede581)

The general NFT marketplace will be ready soon. You will be able to trade all the NFTs on the XDC network and NFTs from other marketplaces…
