# How is the style and how are the NFTs produced?

Our NFTs are generatives, which means that they have been generated depending on some values. The NFTs are 3D figures, so, starting from the premise that they are Prime Numbers, they are divisible by 1 and itself. As a consequence, we have two variables, adding also the position where the prime numbers are located in the list (infinite). For example: with number 7, we could obtain the variables 1, 4, 7 (x, y, z). If "z" minus "y" is a prime number, the NFT would be a special one.

The vectors were created by Xabier.
