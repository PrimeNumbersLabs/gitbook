# Prime Numbers Reward System

### **NFT STAKING REWARDS:** <a href="#b642" id="b642"></a>

### **1- $20,000 PRNT Fixed Reward** <a href="#eb79" id="eb79"></a>

**Formula Staking:**\
a= total multiplier of the NFT\
a = x +y\
x= base multiplier \[multiplier per rarity of the NFT]\
y= added multiplier \[multiplier per level of the NFT]

**We have found a way to make the rewards fair for everyone:**\
b= PRNT staked per NFT

10000 $PRNT given to “a” -> \[Total Multiplier] of the NFTs\
10000 $PRNT given to (“a” \* ”b”) -> \[(Total Multiplier)\*Tokens)]
