# Prime Numbers Reward System

## Prime Numbers Reward System <a href="#5230" id="5230"></a>

In this post, we will explain all the rewards of the Prime Numbers ecosystem.

## PRNT NFT STAKING REWARDS: <a href="#b642" id="b642"></a>

### 1- 20,000 $PRNT Fixed Reward <a href="#4e23" id="4e23"></a>

**Formula Staking:** a= total multiplier of the NFT a = x +y x= base multiplier \[multiplier per rarity of the NFT] y= added multiplier \[multiplier per level of the NFT]

**We have found a way to make the rewards fair for everyone:** b= PRNT staked per NFT

10000 $PRNT given to “a” -> \[Total Multiplier] of the NFTs 10000 $PRNT given to (“a” \* ”b”) -> \[(Total Multiplier)\*Tokens)]

### 2- Prime Numbers NFTs Royalties <a href="#6649" id="6649"></a>

Using the NFT Royalty Standard, NFT holders will receive 50% of all royalties on resales.

The royalties percentage is set at 10%, which means 5% of the sales price of each sold NFT is distributed over all NFT holders.



### 3- Prime Finance <a href="#7896" id="7896"></a>

Prime Numbers NFTs will receive 40% of Prime Numbers Finance profits.&#x20;

TOTAL Reward Pool: 240000 $PRNT\
Reward per year: 120000 $PRNT\
Reward per month: 10000 $PRNT

## XDC Staking inside NFTs: <a href="#3cf4" id="3cf4"></a>

## Rewards: <a href="#f327" id="f327"></a>

These NFTs are going to get the following rewards:

* **VARIABLE REWARD:** 10% of Prime Numbers Finance Profits
* **FIXED REWARD:** In the first two years, 30% of the funds from the minting will be rewarded to the XDC Staking NFTs.

We will give 30% of the funds from the minting because Prime Numbers Finance (Lending and Borrowing Protocol) development is ongoing, and we want to start giving rewards.

The 10% of Prime Numbers Finance profits should be higher than the 30% of the minting funds.\
All of these rewards will be paid on $XDC.

## 1- Fixed Reward <a href="#8910" id="8910"></a>

**30% of the minting funds will be rewarded to the NFTs in the first two years. After these first two years, the non-locked and non-custodial $XDC staking reward will be 10% of the profits from Prime Numbers Finance.**

**PAYOUT Formula Staking**\
a= total multiplier of the NFT\
a = x +y\
x= base multiplier \[multiplier per rarity of the NFT]\
y= added multiplier \[multiplier per level of the NFT]

**We have found a way to make the rewards fair for everyone:**\
b= XDC staked per NFT

HALF XDC REWARD given to “a” -> \[Total Multiplier] of the NFTs\
HALF XDC REWARD given to (“a” \* ”b”) -> \[(Total Multiplier)\*XDC)]

## 2- Prime Finance <a href="#036c" id="036c"></a>

Prime Numbers XDC Staking NFTs will receive 10% of Prime Finance profits.

## XDC NFT Staking (optional): <a href="#a11b" id="a11b"></a>

When your NFT reaches the **MAX LIMIT** (**100 000 $XDC** staked inside the NFT), you will be able to lock this NFT to get an **additional 7% APY**

The lock period will be **one year.**

**The reward will be paid monthly to the NFT.**

Example: You have an NFT with 100 000 $XDC. And you lock it.\
From the lock, you get 7% of 100 000 $XDC -> 7000 $XDC\
And a part of the 10% of Prime Finance profits and an amount of the 30% minting funds.
