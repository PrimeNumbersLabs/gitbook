### General NFT Marketplace \[Multichain] <a href="#2456" id="2456"></a>

The marketplace will be available on the main EVM networks.

The estimated final version will be released in late October.\
The early version will come in September.

We are using SeaPort smart contracts (OpenSea)

Prime Numbers is developing an NFT marketplace with a 1.5% fee.

The fee is 1.5%.\
0.5% is for our hired developers to keep the marketplace updated and add more features.

0,75% will go to one of our DAO funds and we will vote on how to spend this money(for example: create new things, products, more Rewards â€¦)

And 0.25% will go to staking rewards.

### **NFT Bridge to other Networks.** <a href="#d9ad" id="d9ad"></a>

We are working on a bridge for our NFTs.\
The NFTs need to bridge with the tokens inside the NFTs so most of the bridges don't support this.

### Prime Numbers Finance <a href="#000a" id="000a"></a>

PRIME NUMBERS FINANCE is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that enables the borrowing and lending of cryptocurrency, including flash loans.

PRIME NUMBERS FINANCE is built on the XDC network and is the first project in the XDC network that focuses on lending and borrowing cryptocurrency through a pooled liquidity system.

Lenders can earn relatively low-risk, passive income from interest paid on loans, without having to engage with third-parties or middlemen.

Coming to mainnet in late Q4 or early Q1 2023.

### Metaverse Spaceship + Game Development <a href="#f8cc" id="f8cc"></a>

Spaceship airdrop will come at end of the year.\
The owners of a Prime Numbers NFT or an AI-KU NFT will get this free airdrop.

The spaceship is a part of the game. The full game will take more time.
