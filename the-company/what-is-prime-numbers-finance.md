<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

PRIME NUMBERS FINANCE is a **decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that enables the borrowing and lending of cryptocurrency,** including **flash loans.**

PRIME NUMBERS FINANCE is **built on the XDC network,** and is the first project in the XDC network that focuses on **lending and borrowing cryptocurrency through a pooled liquidity system.**

Lenders can earn relatively low-risk, passive income from interest paid on loans, without having to engage with third-parties or middlemen.





## HOW PRIME NUMBERS FINANCE WORKS ?

* Like peers such as Compound, Maker and Aave, **Prime Numbers Finance’s core business is a lending and borrowing platform.**
* Participants deposit funds they wish to lend, which are then collected into a liquidity pool. Borrowers may then draw from those pools when they take out a loan. **These tokens can be traded or transferred as a lender wishes.**&#x20;
* To facilitate this activity, Prime Numbers Finance issues two types of tokens: aTokens, issued to lenders so they can collect interest on deposits, and PRNT tokens, which are the native token of Prime Numbers DAO & Finance.&#x20;
* All loans are overcollateralized, which means **the value of the collateral must be higher than the received value of the borrowed asset;** borrowers can then choose between a fixed and variable interest rate.
*   Loans are also of an indefinite period, which means that a **borrower can hold the borrowed asset for as long as they like,** provided the price of the collateralized asset remains above a certain level.\

    ## $PRNT USE CASES IN PRIME NUMBERS FINANCE

    *   **The PRNT token offers holders several advantages.** For instance, PRNT borrowers don’t get charged a fee if they take out loans denominated in the token. Also, **borrowers who use PRNT as collateral get a discount on fees.**

        &#x20;
    *   PRNT owners can further look at loans before they are released to the general public if they pay a fee in PRNT. Borrowers who post PRNT as collateral can also borrow slightly more.

        &#x20;
    * **PRNT holders who stake their tokens with Prime Numbers NFTs will receive 40% of Prime Numbers Finance profits.**
