# WHY HAVE WE CREATED PRIME NUMBERS?

• Students have always needed a lot of money to pay tuition for their university studies, many of them work hard in order to pay it, but since the COVID 19 arrived this has become much more difficult than before.

• Today, thanks to many collaborators, there is a lot of money coming into the NFTs. Accordingly, we want to raise a small part of it to help those who are going to continue developing this world (the students).
