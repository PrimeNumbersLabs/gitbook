Primeport.xyz is a multichain NFT marketplace where you can trade NFTs from the EVM blockchains.

Prime Port allows you to IMPORT NFT SMART CONTRACTS

The objective of PrimePort is to increase NFT trading, allow users to create collections, and show other communities how good the XDC Network is for minting and trading NFTs.

**We think this is the start of the NFT era on the XDC network!**

In the first release, you will see only a part of the PrimePort.xyz platform, and we will be doing updates non-stop.\

Under this, you can see a roadmap of what is coming to the marketplace:

_NOTE for XDsea & XDCNFT creators: Owners of Smartcontracs from NFT marketplaces (XDCNFT & XDsea) will need to set the royalties that they want._\
_If you minted your NFTs in these marketplaces, if the marketplace doesn't put royalties, you will get 0% royalties from your NFTs._

_If traders choose Primeport.xyz for trading XDsea & XDCNFTs is up to the users. We are a decentralized platform, and everyone can import smart contracts._

## **IMPORTANT INFORMATION:** <a href="#c1c8" id="c1c8"></a>

Primeport.xyz will be in non-stop development. If you find some errors/bugs, please report it to admin@primenumbers.xyz or telegram.

**XDCPAY only works for seeing your NFTs and profile. XDCpay doesn't work with NFT trading.**

**Remember to use the RPC endpoint:** [**https://erpc.xinfin.network**](https://erpc.xinfin.network/)

**Only wallet providers that can use the previous RPC can trade.**

**D’CENT works if you connect DCENT to metamask.**

**We recommend using hardware wallets and connecting them to metamask (safest way).**
