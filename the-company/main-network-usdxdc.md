# Main Network $XDC

For the development of our project, we have chosen XDC, due to its outstanding relationship with the team and all of its advantages over the other networks.

**WHY XDC NETWORK?**

The XDC Network is a hybrid blockchain (public/private) that combines the benefits of both types of ledgers and offers services to businesses and institutions.

The open-source protocol software uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS) consensus mechanism and is compatible with EVM, enabling fast transactions (2000TPS), interoperability, and cybersecurity.

XDC works on interbank solutions and financial services related to Trade Finance, ISO 20022, and R3 Corda.

In this manner, their blockchain's relationships with the private finance sector are robust, while at the same time, they have a public network with exceptional capabilities.
