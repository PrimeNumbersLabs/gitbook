# Prime Numbers Labs: Polygon Blockchain

## Prime Numbers Labs: Pioneering NFTs on Polygon Blockchain

Prime Numbers Labs, a trailblazer in the blockchain industry, is set to launch its cutting-edge technology on the Polygon Blockchain. This strategic move will enable the creation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that can be utilized for hosting NODES, further enhancing the capabilities of the blockchain ecosystem.

### Expanding the Prime Numbers Ecosystem

In a bid to expand its reach and functionality, Prime Numbers Labs will implement the Polygon blockchain on Primeport and Prime Numbers Finance. This integration will streamline operations and provide users with a seamless experience across the platforms.

Primeport, the multichain platform for trading NFTs from all EVM blockchains, will benefit from the scalability and flexibility of the Polygon blockchain. This will enhance the platform's performance and user experience, while also increasing the value proposition for PRNT NFT holders who receive a portion of the marketplace's generated fees.

Similarly, Prime Numbers Finance, the first cryptocurrency and NFT lending and borrowing platform on the XDC network will leverage the Polygon blockchain's high-speed and low-cost transactions. This will enhance the platform's efficiency and profitability, with a portion of the generated revenue directed towards XXXX Holders.

### New Partnerships on the Horizon

In addition to these exciting developments, Prime Numbers Labs is set to welcome a significant partner to help develop sports and art on PrimePort. This collaboration will further diversify the offerings on the platform, providing users with more options and opportunities in the NFT space.
