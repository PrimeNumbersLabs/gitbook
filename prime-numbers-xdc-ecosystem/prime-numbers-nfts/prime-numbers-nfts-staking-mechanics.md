# PRNT Staking Mechanics

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark> <a href="#id-5932" id="id-5932"></a>

We present to you our revolutionary staking system using NFTs.

To earn various rewards within the Prime Numbers ecosystem you will need to stake your $PRNT tokens inside our revolutionary NFTs. By staking with us you gain access to numerous rewards such as...

* Rewards from the PRNT rewards pool
* A portion of the NFT Royalties from the PrimePort NFT Marketplace
* 40% of the profits from Prime Finance, the first borrowing and lending protocol built on the XDC Network

Our staking system is revolutionary because it means your staked PRNT tokens will give intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT at any point in time by “breaking open” the NFT which is then destroyed in the process. You can also withdraw your tokens without destroying the NFT, however, this comes at a cost which is a 20% fee which then gets placed in the rewards pool and distributed back to the current NFT holders.

When you stake PRNT tokens inside your NFT it will gradually level up which increases the multiplier of your NFT. The higher your multiplier the more rewards you earn from the rewards pool compared to other NFTs in circulation.

### <mark style="color:purple;">The Structure Of The NFTs…</mark> <a href="#d7e3" id="d7e3"></a>

Each NFT has the same structure. It consists of…

* **A Base Multiplier -** The NFTs have a rarity that determines the base multiplier for that NFT. The table below shows the different rarities and their corresponding base multiplier…

* **An Added Multiplier -** As you level up your NFT it increases the added multiplier as shown in the table below…

As you can see in the table above, every level you complete adds 0.1 to your added multiplier. Once your NFT reaches the max level of 20 your added multiplier will be maxed out at 2.0

**An Added Multiplier -** When you add the Base Multiplier and Added Multiplier together it gives you the Total Multiplier for your NFT.&#x20;

The Total Multiplier determines how many rewards your NFT gets from the rewards pool each month.

Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier

## <mark style="color:purple;">Frequently Asked Questions</mark> <a href="#a7be" id="a7be"></a>

* **When do I receive my rewards?**\
  Your rewards will be available to claim on the last day of each month.
*   **Do the rewards I claim contribute toward levelling up my NFT?**

    Yes they do

## <mark style="color:purple;">NFT Interface Buttons</mark> <a href="#id-9afb" id="id-9afb"></a>

* **The “Stake” Button**\
  This button is used to stake PRNT tokens inside your NFT. Simply enter the amount you wish to stake, approve the PRNT and then confirm the stake transaction.
* **The “Get Surplus” Button**\
  Once your NFT has reached the top level then the Get Surplus button will become available. This allows you to withdraw any PRNT tokens, free of charge, from your NFT that are above the balance of 8,298 PRNT tokens.
* **The “Burn To Redeem” Button**\
  This button breaks open the NFT and sends all the PRNT tokens inside of it back to your wallet. This action CANNOT be reversed, it will burn your NFT and send all the PRNT tokens back to your wallet.
* **The “Transfer” Button**\
  This button is used for transferring NFTs between wallets.
* **The “Withdraw PRNT” Button**\
  This button allows you to withdraw PRNT tokens from your NFT without destroying it. However, there's a 20% fee for doing this so if you withdrew 100 PRNT tokens, 80 would get sent to your wallet and the other 20 would get sent to the rewards pool and distributed back to the other NFT holders at the end of the month.
* **The “Claim PRNT” Button**\
  On the last day of each month, you can press the Claim PRNT button to claim your PRNT rewards which will then get added to your NFT.
* **The “Sell” Button**\
  By pressing the sell button it'll take you to the PrimePort marketplace where you can then sell your NFT by listing it or starting an auction.
* **The “Merge NFTs” Button**\
  Pressing this button allows you to merge two NFTs of the same rarity together to create an NFT of a higher rarity.
