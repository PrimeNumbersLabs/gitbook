## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark> <a href="#id-7c88" id="id-7c88"></a>

Our collection consists of 4,111 NFTs, of which 4,096 are generative NFTs and 15 are handmade NFTs. In addition, pre sale participants received an OG NFT depending on how much they invested.

During the PRNT Staking NFT minting period, only 2,333 NFTs were minted so the original supply was halved from the very beginning making those NFTs in circulation far more valuable.

The first 15 Prime Numbers will consist of handcrafted images from our Art Director. They are creative paintings that each represent one of the first 15 prime numbers. The handmade Prime Numbers are unique, and will never again be minted.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Generative</mark> <a href="#id-0cde" id="id-0cde"></a>

The artwork of our generative NFTs consists of the following elements:

* a prime number
* sensual vegetation
* a geometric figure
* a feminine shape
* futuristic background lines
* A background colour fade with complementing colours

The prime numbers will be generated at minting time sequentially, starting at the 16th prime number up to the 4,111th prime number. Each generated number is unique and will be minted only once, ever.

The art elements behind the number graphic each have 8 variations all with a different rarity that has a certain chance of being randomly chosen.

The following chances are assigned to the different rarities:

This makes 8⁵ = 32,768 different combinations possible, meaning many of the combinations will not be minted, and the uniqueness factor of the minted NFTs will be very high.

Each generative NFT will be unique, and there will be no others like it.

The Generative NFTs will increase in price as more get minted. We want to reward early minters by getting a better price, however, we ensure the curve is not too punishing for later participants.

## <mark style="color:purple;">NFTs Rarity</mark> <a href="#b805" id="b805"></a>

The NFTs in our collection each have their own global rarity. We explained in the previous chapter how each of the segments of the NFT has its own rarity, combining the rarity of the segments determines the overall rarity of the NFT. Each rarity grants an increasing base multiplier when you are staking.

Next, we explain how the rarity of each part of the NFT is calculated.

With the probability explained above, we take the 5 parts with their different rarities.

For example:

* sensual vegetation → Mythic (7)
* a geometric figure → Epic (5)
* a feminine shape → Legendary (6)
* futuristic background lines → Rare (4)
* A background color fade with complementing colors → Godly (8)

We do the following calculation: (7 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 8) / 5 = 5.8

We round up. Then our rarity will be Legendary (6).

Once the form of obtaining the rarity and how unique these NFTs are has been created, you can see below the table in which the multiplier that each NFT carries is detailed.

You can increase these percentages with the information we share in the ''Next'' page (PRNT Staking Mechanics).
