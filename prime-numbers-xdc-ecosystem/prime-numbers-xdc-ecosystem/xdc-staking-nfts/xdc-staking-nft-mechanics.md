# XDC Staking NFT Mechanics

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark>

We present to you our revolutionary staking system featuring NFTs.

To earn rewards with XDC Staking NFTs, you must stake your $XDC. This does not happen in an ordinary way; however, when we stake at the Prime Numbers ecosystem, we stake inside the NFTs. This means your staked tokens will give an intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT by "Empty NFT," "Withdraw XDC," or "BurnToRedeem."

When we stake our tokens in the NFT, they will gradually level up. You will be able to stake as much as you want until the max limit \[100 000 $XDC per NFT]

Your share depends on the Multiplier of your NFT, which is based on both its level(added Multiplier) and its rarity(base multiplier).

The higher your level and the more rarity you have, the more reward you will get.

These NFTs, upon receiving the tokens, will level up from this. The staking airdrop will be factored in based on the amount of $XDC inside the NFT.

**Max limit \[100 000 $XDC per NFT]**\
**100 000 $XDC is the maximum amount you can stake, but the NFT XDC balance can go above 100 000 $XDC due to rewards.**

#### Total Multipliers

Depending on your Base Rarity and/or level, you will get a Total Multiplier.

{% hint style="success" %}
Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier
{% endhint %}

Example:

NFT with Base Multiplier 2.0 and level 18 (added multiplier 1.8) will be a total multiplier of 3.8

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **When are the staking rewards sent?**\
  Smart-contract sends the rewards on the last day of every month.
* **When a person is in the process of leveling up, a reward drop occurs. Since the rewards drop into the NFT, does that help increase the levels?**\
  Yes. But you need to stake to advance to the next level!

## <mark style="color:purple;">NFT Interface Buttons</mark> <a href="#id-9afb" id="id-9afb"></a>

* **The “Stake” Button**\
  This button is used to stake XDC tokens inside your NFT. Simply enter the amount you wish to stake and then confirm the stake transaction.
* **The “Get Surplus” Button**\
  Once your NFT has reached the top level then the Get Surplus button will become available. This allows you to withdraw any XDC tokens from your NFT that are above the balance of 100,000 XDC tokens.
* **The “Withdraw XDC” Button**\
  This button allows you to withdraw XDC tokens from your NFT without destroying it. Simply enter how much you want to withdraw and then click accept and that amount of tokens will get sent back to your wallet.
* **The “Burn To Redeem” Button**\
  This button breaks open the NFT and sends all the XDC tokens inside of it back to your wallet. This action CANNOT be reversed, it will burn your NFT and send all the XDC tokens back to your wallet. You also receive 30 PRNT tokens as a bonus for burning your NFT.

This button locks this NFT for one year and one month to earn an additional 7% APY. When your NFT reaches the MAX LIMIT (100 000 $XDC staked inside the NFT), you can lock the NFT to get this reward. NFTs that are locked cannot utilize Burn To Redeem, Merge NFTs, or Withdraw XDC features.
