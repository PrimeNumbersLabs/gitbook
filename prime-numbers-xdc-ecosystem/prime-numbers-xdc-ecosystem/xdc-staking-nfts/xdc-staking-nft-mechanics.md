# XDC Staking NFT Mechanics

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark>

We present to you our revolutionary staking system using NFTs.

To earn various rewards within the Prime Numbers ecosystem you will need to stake your $XDC tokens inside our revolutionary NFTs. By staking with us you gain access to numerous rewards such as...

* Rewards from the XDC rewards pool
* 10% of the profits from Prime Finance, the first borrowing and lending protocol built on the XDC Network

Our staking system is revolutionary because it means your staked XDC tokens will give intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT at any point in time providing it's not locked up in one of our master nodes. Simply use the withdraw XDC button to empty the NFT and send all the XDC inside of it back to your wallet.

When you stake XDC tokens inside your NFT it will gradually level up which increases the multiplier of your NFT. The higher your multiplier the more rewards you earn from the rewards pool compared to other NFTs in circulation. 100,000 XDC is the maximum amount of tokens you can stake inside of our NFTs.

### <mark style="color:purple;">The Structure Of The NFTs…</mark> <a href="#d7e3" id="d7e3"></a>

Each NFT has the same structure. It consists of…

* **A Base Multiplier -** The NFTs have a rarity that determines the base multiplier for that NFT. The table below shows the different rarities and their corresponding base multiplier…

* **An Added Multiplier -** As you level up your NFT it increases the added multiplier as shown in the table below…

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/11.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Your share of the rewards depends on the Total Multiplier of your NFT, which is based on both its rarity (Base Multiplier) and its level (Added Multiplier).

{% hint style="success" %}
Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier
{% endhint %}

Example:

NFT with Base Multiplier 2.0 and level 18 (Added Multiplier 1.8) will be a Total Multiplier of 3.8

The higher the level and rarity of your NFT, the more rewards you will receive at the end of each month. The rewards you claim at the end of each month will go into your NFT and contribute towards levelling it up. The maximum that can be staked inside an NFT is 100,000 XDC. Once it reaches this amount your rewards will continue to be added to your NFT each month and you can withdraw the excess XDC by using the "Get Surplus" button.
