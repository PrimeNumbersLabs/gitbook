# XDC Staking NFT Mechanics

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark>

We present to you our revolutionary staking system using NFTs.

To earn various rewards within the Prime Numbers ecosystem you will need to stake your $XDC tokens inside our revolutionary NFTs. By staking with us you gain access to numerous rewards such as...

* Rewards from the XDC rewards pool
* 10% of the profits from Prime Finance, the first borrowing and lending protocol built on the XDC Network

Our staking system is revolutionary because it means your staked XDC tokens will give intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT at any point in time providing it's not locked up in one of our master nodes. Simply use the withdraw XDC button to empty the NFT and send all the XDC inside of it back to your wallet.

When you stake XDC tokens inside your NFT it will gradually level up which increases the multiplier of your NFT. The higher your multiplier the more rewards you earn from the rewards pool compared to other NFTs in circulation. 100,000 XDC is the maximum amount of tokens you can stake inside of our NFTs.





Your share depends on the Multiplier of your NFT, which is based on both its level(added Multiplier) and its rarity(base multiplier).

The higher your level and the more rarity you have, the more reward you will get.

These NFTs, upon receiving the tokens, will level up from this. The staking airdrop will be factored in based on the amount of $XDC inside the NFT.

**Max limit \[100 000 $XDC per NFT]**\
**100 000 $XDC is the maximum amount you can stake, but the NFT XDC balance can go above 100 000 $XDC due to rewards.**

#### Total Multipliers

Depending on your Base Rarity and/or level, you will get a Total Multiplier.

{% hint style="success" %}
Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier
{% endhint %}

Example:

NFT with Base Multiplier 2.0 and level 18 (added multiplier 1.8) will be a total multiplier of 3.8

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **When are the staking rewards sent?**\
  Smart-contract sends the rewards on the last day of every month.
* **When a person is in the process of leveling up, a reward drop occurs. Since the rewards drop into the NFT, does that help increase the levels?**\
  Yes. But you need to stake to advance to the next level!
