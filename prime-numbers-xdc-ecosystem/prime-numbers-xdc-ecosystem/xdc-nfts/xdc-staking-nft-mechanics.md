# XDC Staking NFT Mechanics

## Introduction

We present to you our revolutionary staking system featuring NFTs.

To earn rewards with XDC Staking NFTs, you must stake your $XDC. This does not happen in an ordinary way; however, when we stake at the Prime Numbers ecosystem, we stake inside the NFTs. This means your staked tokens will give an intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT by "Empty NFT," "Withdraw XDC," or "BurnToRedeem."

When we stake our tokens in the NFT, they will gradually level up. You will be able to stake as much as you want until the max limit \[100 000 $XDC per NFT]

Your share depends on the Multiplier of your NFT, which is based on both its level(added Multiplier) and its rarity(base multiplier).

The higher your level and the more rarity you have, the more reward you will get.

These NFTs, upon receiving the tokens, will level up from this. The staking airdrop will be factored in based on the amount of $XDC inside the NFT.

**Max limit \[100 000 $XDC per NFT]**\
**100 000 $XDC is the maximum amount you can stake, but the NFT XDC balance can go above 100 000 $XDC due to rewards.**

#### Total Multipliers

Depending on your Base Rarity and/or level, you will get a Total Multiplier.

Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier
{% endhint %}

Example:

NFT with Base Multiplier 2.0 and level 18 (added multiplier 1.8) will be a total multiplier of 3.8

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **When are the staking rewards sent?**\
  Smart-contract sends the rewards on the last day of every month.
* **When a person is in the process of leveling up, a reward drop occurs. Since the rewards drop into the NFT, does that help increase the levels?**\
  Yes. But you need to stake to advance to the next level!

## Staking Interface Buttons

* **"Stake" Button**\
  This button is used for stake inside the NFT.
* **"Transfer" Button**\
  This button is used for transferring NFTs between wallets.
* **"WITHDRAW XDC" Button**\
  This button takes out the NFT balance.\
  To use this button, you need the NFT without interactions the previous seven days before using **"WITHDRAW XDC."**\
  Interaction = Transfer, Stake
* **"BurnToRedeem" Button**\
  This button breaks the NFT and extracts all the $XDC inside the NFT.\
  **It cannot be reversed;** it will burn your NFT and send all the XDC to your wallet. Also, **you get 30 $PRNT when you break the NFT.**
* **"Merge NFTs" Button**\
  This button **merges 2 NFTs of the same rarity to get one of the following rarities.**
* **"LOCK NFT" Button**\
  This button locks this NFT for one year and one month to get an **additional 7% APY.**\
  When your NFT reaches the **MAX LIMIT** (**100 000 $XDC** staked inside the NFT), you can lock this NFT to get this reward.\
  **NFTs that are locked cannot utilize BurnToRedeem, Merge NFTs, or WithdrawXDC features.**

## Summary

After reading the entire post, we can get the following conclusions:

Due to our level system, trying to achieve the highest level can be very interesting and rewarding. By actively leveling your NFT, you quickly raise the reward multiplier, resulting in a larger slice of the $XDC pie.

Depending on the rarity of the NFT and level, you can get up to +4x in the rewards.
