# PRNT Staking Mechanics

## Introduction <a href="#id-5932" id="id-5932"></a>

We present to you our revolutionary staking system featuring NFTs.

In order to earn various rewards with Prime Numbers, such as a portion of the NFT royalties, the NFT reward mechanism, and in-game rewards, you will need to stake your $PRNT tokens. This does not happen in an ordinary way however. This means your staked tokens will give an intrinsic value to the NFT and can be traded along with the NFT on any NFT marketplace as a packaged deal. The tokens can be recovered from the NFT at any point in time by “breaking open” the NFT which is then destroyed in the process.

When we stake our tokens in the NFT, it will gradually level up. There is a maximum potency that we can stake on a daily basis, so we have to repeat this process on a regular basis, not more than once a day.

The higher your level and the more rarity you have the more reward you will get.

This article will detail all the mechanics behind the PRNT Staking NFT collection. This collection of NFTs is revolutionary because you can stake tokens inside of the NFT which contributes towards leveling it up.

### The Structure Of The NFTs… <a href="#d7e3" id="d7e3"></a>

Each NFT has the same structure. It consists of…

* **A Base Multiplier -** The NFTs have a rarity that determines the base multiplier for that NFT. The table below shows the different rarities and their corresponding base multiplier…

* **An Added Multiplier -** As you level up your NFT it increases the added multiplier as shown in the table below…

As you can see in the table above, every level you complete adds 0.1 to your added multiplier. Once your NFT reaches the max level of 20 your added multiplier will be maxed out at 2.0

**An Added Multiplier -** When you add the Base Multiplier and Added Multiplier together it gives you the Total Multiplier for your NFT.&#x20;

The Total Multiplier determines how many rewards your NFT gets from the rewards pool each month.

Total Multiplier = Base Multiplier + Added Multiplier

## _Frequently Asked Questions_ <a href="#a7be" id="a7be"></a>

* **When the staking rewards are sent?**\
  Smart-contract send the rewards on the last day of every month.
* **When a person is in the process of leveling up, and a rewards drop takes place. Since the rewards drop into the NFT, does that help increase the levels?**\
  Yes.

## Staking Interface Buttons <a href="#id-9afb" id="id-9afb"></a>

* **“Staking” Button**\
  This button is used for stake inside the NFT. This button follows the staking rules. Sometimes you will need a lower amount of the daily max allowed because you need less $PRNT to level up your NFT.
* **“Transfer” Button**\
  This button is used for transferring NFTs between wallets.
* **“BurnToRedeem” Button**\
  This button breaks the NFT and takes out all the $PRNT inside the NFT.\
  It cannot be reversed, it will burn your NFT and send all the PRNT to your wallet.
* **“Instant Stake” Button**\
  This button allows you to stake whatever you want amount but you pay a 5% fee of the introduced amount. This fee goes to the reward pool. If you introduce 10000 $PRNT -> 9500$ PRNT to the stake and 500$ PRNT for the fee.
* **“GetSurplus” Button**\
  This button takes out the NFT the balance above 8298 $PRNT. It means that any value above 8298 $PRNT can be withdrawn.\
  To use this button you need the NFT without interactions the previous 15 days of trying using “GetSurplus”.\
  Interaction = Transfer, Stake

## Summary <a href="#id-04fc" id="id-04fc"></a>

After reading the entire post we can get the following conclusions:

Due to our level system, it can be very interesting and rewarding to try to achieve the highest level. Just by actively leveling your NFT you quickly raise in reward multiplier, resulting in a larger slice of the $PRNT pie.

Depending on the rarity of the NFT and its level, you can get up to +4x in the rewards.
