## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark>

Our XDC Staking NFTs are the first non-custodial and trustless XDC staking system built on the XDC Network. This NFT collection has great utility because the NFTs are like "vaults" where you can store your XDC and earn rewards at the same time in numerous different ways.

The collection consists of 5,557 NFTs, of which Prime Numbers make 5,542, and 15 have the same aspect as the Prime Numbers Handmade NFTs.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Different Rarities:</mark>

#### Prime Numbers Handmade NFTs

The first 15 Prime Numbers consist of handcrafted images from our Art Director.

The owners of these Prime Numbers Handmade NFTs will get three XDC Staking NFTs for free.

Base Multiplier = 2.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Merge System**</mark>

We are happy to show you how our merge NFTs system works.

**You can merge 2 NFTs of the same rarity to get one of the following rarities.**

Examples: \
The merge of **2 common NFTs** will make **one uncommon NFT.**\
The merge of **2 mythic NFTs** will make **one godly NFT.**

**Godly** is the best rarity you can get using the **merge system**.

When you merge 2 NFTs, these 2 NFTs get burned, and you get 1 NFT of the next rarity.

This makes the NFTs deflationary.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Refund System</mark>

Here, we show you how our merge NFTs system works.

**You can use the "BurnToRedeem" button to get 30 $PRNT (Refund System)**

This button breaks the NFT and extracts all the $XDC inside the NFT.\
It cannot be reversed; it will burn your NFT and send all the XDC to your wallet. Also, you get 30 $PRNT when you break the NFT.

Examples: \
1- If you test and don't like how the staking system or rewards work, you can decide to "BurnToRedeem" the NFT to get 30 $PRNT.

2- You minted and got one low rarity, and you prefer 30 $PRNT; you can also use this system.

3- The 30 $PRNT is more valuable than the NFT, and you decide to use "BurnToRedeem" as an investment option.

This makes the NFTs deflationary.
