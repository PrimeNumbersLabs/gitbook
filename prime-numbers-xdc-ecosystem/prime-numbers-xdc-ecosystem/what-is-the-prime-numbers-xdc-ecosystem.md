# What Is The Prime Numbers XDC Ecosystem?

Prime Numbers Labs combines the flexibility of Ethereum smart contract development with the speed and the business environment of XDC.

Our ecosystem generates revenue through the fees created by Prime Finance, the first lending and borrowing protocol on XDC. It also generates returns through other systems.

We reward our community through our NFT collections, which have a revolutionary staking system: You stake tokens inside your NFTs to earn rewards.
