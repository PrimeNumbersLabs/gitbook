# Prime Numbers Logo

As a premise for the logo´s creation of “Prime Numbers”, we wanted to look for a symbolism that would represent them.

After studying these numbers and how they are created, we discovered a theory presented by Jason Davies, through Omar E. Pol's research on the geometric determination of prime and perfect numbers. In it he shows, among other things, "The model of periodic overlapping curves" which is represented in this curious form, , creating a "pattern" as can be seen in the graph below.

From the origin of the number line, a periodic curve is drawn for each natural number. Each curve must intersect the natural number and its multiples. Finally, the numbers that have been intercepted by only 2 curves are highligh- ted with a thick stitch: these are the prime numbers.

In order to do this, we wanted to simulate the curious shapes that the prime numbers create and turn them into a logo that is totally symbolic and at the same time very close to the NFT´s works with that futuristic retro style.

Using the forms that are created thanks to the interlacing and together with that nucleus that would be the thick point that intercepts the prime numbers.
