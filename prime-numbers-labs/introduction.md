# Introduction

Prime Numbers emerged in 2021, initially with the aspiration to make a significant contribution to the academic community. However, our concept has since undergone significant transformation, to the point where our current vision bears little resemblance to the initial proposal.

Navigating through the XDC Network during our developmental phase was far from simple. We meticulously constructed our infrastructure from scratch within the network. Amidst this process, we discovered an immense potential lying within our unique Liquid NFT Staking System.

Our journey started with the development of our groundbreaking staking system. This was followed by the launch of Primeport.xyz, an innovative NFT marketplace. The next phase is the introduction of Prime Finance, our lending and borrowing protocol.

Yet, our progress doesn't end here. We are steadfast in our commitment to refine and expand our suite of offerings. We regularly roll out updates on a weekly basis to ensure continuous enhancement of our products.

Marking a new milestone, we're delighted to announce the inception of **Prime Numbers Labs**!
