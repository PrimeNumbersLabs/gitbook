# WHAT IS PRIME NUMBERS LABS?

Prime Numbers Labs is the entity responsible for the creation of a multitude of thriving ecosystems. The first and most renowned is the Prime Numbers XDC Ecosystem, our birthplace and the stepping stone to becoming the entity we are today. In our view, this is just the start.

Prime Numbers Labs' portfolio can be divided into four distinct components:

1. At the core of our offerings is the Liquid NFT Staking System. This system comprises a collection of NFTs with built-in staking capabilities, thereby giving each NFT an inherent value. The possible applications of this system are endless, with some notable examples including the generation of masternodes, LP staking rewards, and token staking rewards. The system has been operational since May 2022 and garnered our community a strong appreciation.
2. Prime Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol facilitating the lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency. As the first project on the XDC network focusing on cryptocurrency lending and borrowing through a pooled liquidity system, PRIME FINANCE allows lenders to earn relatively low-risk, passive income from loan interest, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries. The protocol also includes NFT lending and borrowing.\
   The NFT lending opens the door to allow collateral tokenized assets.
