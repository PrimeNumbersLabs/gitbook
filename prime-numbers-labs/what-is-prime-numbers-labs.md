# What Is Prime Numbers Labs?

Prime Numbers Labs is a truly rewarding DeFi ecosystem that combines Prime Finance's lending and borrowing protocol and PrimePort NFT Marketplace with the Prime Numbers NFT Staking System.

Prime Numbers Labs is responsible for creating a multitude of thriving ecosystems. The first is the Prime Numbers XDC Ecosystem, our birthplace and the stepping stone to becoming the entity we are today. Now Prime Numbers Labs is expanding to more EVM blockchains, like Ethereum.\
\
Prime Numbers Labs' portfolio can be divided into four distinct components:



* [PRNT NFT Collection](../prime-numbers-xdc-ecosystem/prime-numbers-nfts/): Central to our ecosystem, this collection offers unique advantages, including economic benefits and a share in ecosystem fees.\
  \
  PRNT NFTs possess unique qualities and characteristics. They are the nexus connecting the entire Prime Numbers Labs ecosystem on any network. They offer numerous advantages and user experiences that a regular user does not have, including a system that allows you to stake inside the NFT and earn rewards. The collection receives a share of the fees generated by the rest of the ecosystem.

* [XDC NFT Collection](../prime-numbers-xdc-ecosystem/xdc-staking-nfts/): Exclusive in the Prime Numbers XDC Ecosystem offers XDC Staking benefits and a share in XDC ecosystem fees.

Our XDC Staking NFTs are the first non-custodial and trustless XDC staking system built on the XDC Network.

This NFT collection has great utility because NFTs are like "vaults" where you can store your XDC and earn rewards simultaneously in numerous different ways.\
\
XDC NFTs possess unique qualities and characteristics. They serve as a way of XDC Staking and masternode rewards.

* [PrimePort](https://primeport.xyz/) is a multichain NFT marketplace currently deployed on the XDC Network. It supports NFT collection creation, trading, and staking information for the Prime Numbers Labs NFT Staking System. PrimePort will be deployed in the EVM networks that the PRNT NFTs will be.\
  \
  PrimePort is the first NFT Marketplace on the XDC Blockchain. It has a user-friendly interface, and a portion of the secondary sales is distributed to our NFT holders. We created it as a place to trade our NFTs.

It offers low-risk, passive income opportunities without third-party intermediaries. It includes rewards to liquidity providers with the platform fees captured in blue-chip assets.\

  Prime Finance is our heart and the most essential part of the ecosystem. This protocol will offer lending and borrowing of crypto assets and unique functionalities like concentrated liquidity through your assets, collateralizing NFTs for loans, and fractionalizing your NFTs for renting.
