# WHAT IS PRIME NUMBERS LABS?

Prime Numbers Labs is the entity responsible for the creation of a multitude of thriving ecosystems. The first and most renowned is the Prime Numbers XDC Ecosystem, our birthplace, and the stepping stone to becoming the entity we are today. In our view, this is just the start.

Prime Numbers Labs' portfolio can be divided into four distinct components:

1. At the core of our offerings are the XDC and PRNT NFT collections. They are the main collections within Prime Numbers Labs. Each of them possesses unique qualities and characteristics. They serve as the nexus connecting the entire ecosystem on any network. They offer numerous advantages and user experiences that a regular user does not have, including economic benefits. Both collections receive a share of the fees generated by the rest of the ecosystem.
2. &#x20;XDC NFT Staking System. This system comprises a collection of NFTs with built-in staking capabilities, thereby giving each NFT an inherent value. We will host the masternode for you so that you can stake. The system has been operational for 18 months and has garnered a strong appreciation from our community.
3. Primeport.xyz is a multichain NFT marketplace that serves as the hub of the Prime Numbers ecosystem, allowing the trading of NFTs from any EVM blockchain. Built on the XDC Network and launched on December 9th, 2022, PrimePort enables the creation of NFT collections and, crucially, grants ownership of the smart contract to you. Given the ever-changing nature of the NFT space, PrimePort remains an evolving project, adapting and updating in response to shifts in the landscape.&#x20;
4. Prime Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol facilitating the lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency. As the first project on the XDC network focusing on cryptocurrency lending and borrowing through a pooled liquidity system, PRIME FINANCE allows lenders to earn relatively low-risk, passive income from loan interest, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries. The protocol also includes NFT lending and borrowing.

Together, these four elements empower us to deliver "must-have" services to any web3 user.
