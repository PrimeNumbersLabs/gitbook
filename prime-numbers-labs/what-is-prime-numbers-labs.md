# WHAT IS PRIME NUMBERS LABS?

Prime Numbers Labs is the entity responsible for the creation of a multitude of thriving ecosystems. The first and most renowned is the Prime Numbers XDC Ecosystem, our birthplace, and the stepping stone to becoming the entity we are today. In our view, this is just the start.

Prime Numbers Labs' portfolio can be divided into four distinct components:

1. At the core of our offerings is the Liquid NFT Staking System. This system comprises a collection of NFTs with built-in staking capabilities, thereby giving each NFT an inherent value. The possible applications of this system are endless, with some notable examples including the generation of masternodes, LP staking rewards, and token staking rewards. The system has been operational for 18 months and has garnered a strong appreciation from our community.
2. Primeport.xyz is a multichain NFT marketplace that serves as the hub of the Prime Numbers ecosystem, allowing the trading of NFTs from any EVM blockchain. Built on the XDC Network and launched on December 9th, 2022, PrimePort enables the creation of NFT collections and, crucially, grants ownership of the smart contract to you. Given the ever-changing nature of the NFT space, PrimePort remains an evolving project, adapting and updating in response to shifts in the landscape. Prime Numbers Labs is planning to integrate additional blockchains into PrimePort, such as ETH, Polygon, and KCC.
3. Prime Numbers Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol facilitating the lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency. As the first project on the XDC network focusing on cryptocurrency lending and borrowing through a pooled liquidity system, PRIME NUMBERS FINANCE allows lenders to earn relatively low-risk, passive income from loan interest, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries. The protocol also includes NFT lending and borrowing, and there are plans to incorporate additional blockchains like ETH, Polygon, and KCC.

Together, these three elements empower us to deliver "must-have" services to any blockchain.

4. Tokenizing Web2 systems via our NFT system is another focus of ours. With the flexibility of our NFT system, we can generate digital membership cards, progress levels for users (in casinos, games, etc.), bank accounts, and more. This segment of Prime Numbers Labs is in its infancy, and we are currently collaborating with several companies interested in utilizing this system.
