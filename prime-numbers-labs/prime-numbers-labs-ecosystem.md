## Prime Finance Liquidity Protocol

Prime Finance has different types of fees:

* Borrowing Fees: These fees are variable depending on the crypto asset and are distributed between the Users, Company, PRNT NFTs, and XDC NFTs.
* Liquidation Fees: A 15% fee applies to a liquidation event; the reward is split between the liquidator and the protocol.
* Extra Fees: Penalty fees go to the treasury.
