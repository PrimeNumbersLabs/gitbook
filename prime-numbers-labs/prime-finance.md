**Key Features of Prime Finance**:

1. **Security and Openness**: Prime Finance, renowned for its robust security framework, will be fully audited and open-source, ensuring maximum transparency and safety. The protocol offers user-friendly interaction through web interfaces, APIs, or direct engagement with network smart contracts and encourages the development of third-party integrations and applications.
2. **Active Participation in the Ecosystem**: Users can seamlessly integrate into the Prime Finance ecosystem by depositing assets. These assets provide passive income based on market demand and allow for asset-backed borrowing. This dual functionality balances the cost of borrowing with the interest accrued from deposits.
3. **Secure Asset Storage**: Utilizing robust and transparent smart contracts, Prime Finance guarantees the safety of users’ funds. These open-source contracts will be regularly audited, ensuring reliability and security. Users can withdraw or convert their funds into pTokens for trading on the blockchain.
4. **Comprehensive Risk Management**: Prime Finance acknowledges the inherent risks in DeFi, such as potential smart contract vulnerabilities and the challenges in the liquidation process. The platform employs continuous audits and public code reviews to mitigate these and maintains an active bug bounty program.
5. **PRNT Token: The Governance and Security Cornerstone**: The PRNT token is integral to Prime Finance's governance. It enables token holders to vote on Prime Finance Improvement Proposals (PFIPs) and influence the protocol's trajectory.

**Innovations in Lending and Borrowing**:

* Prime Finance stands out for integrating NFTs into the lending and borrowing framework. This unique feature and an NFT marketplace allow for novel lending and borrowing opportunities involving NFTs.

**Profit Sharing and NFT Integration**:
