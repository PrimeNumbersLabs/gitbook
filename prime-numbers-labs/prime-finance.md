# Prime Finance

Prime Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, operating on the XDC network, which pioneers the concept of lending and borrowing cryptocurrency through a pooled liquidity system. This protocol, which is compatible with most EVM networks, provides lenders with an opportunity to earn a stable, relatively risk-free income from interest on loans, all while bypassing the need for intermediaries.

A unique feature of this protocol is the integration of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) into its lending and borrowing framework.

Operating in a manner similar to established protocols like Compound, Maker, and Aave, Prime Numbers Finance bases its functionality on a lending and borrowing platform. Users deposit funds intended for lending into a liquidity pool, which borrowers can then access to secure loans. The platform issues two types of tokens to facilitate this process: aTokens for lenders to accumulate interest on their deposits, and PRNT tokens, the native tokens for Prime Numbers Labs.

The loans are overcollateralized, meaning the collateral's value exceeds the loaned asset's value, and borrowers can opt between fixed and variable interest rates. Furthermore, the loans are indefinite, allowing borrowers to retain the borrowed asset as long as the collateralized asset's price remains above a certain threshold.

The PRNT token offers holders a multitude of benefits. For instance, loans in PRNT do not incur fees, and borrowers using PRNT as collateral receive discounted fees.

Moreover, PRNT owners can access loans before they are made available to the public for a PRNT fee. They can also borrow more if they use PRNT as collateral.

The innovative feature of Lending & Borrowing NFTs is also included in Prime Finance. This comes hand in hand with an NFT marketplace that offers options for lending and borrowing NFTs.

Through the Liquid NFT Staking System developed by Prime Numbers Labs, users can leverage the funds within their NFTs for use across additional protocols or NFTs. This further extends the versatility and utility of the system, enabling enhanced yield optimization and asset management.
