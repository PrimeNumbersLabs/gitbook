# Liquid NFT Staking System

The Liquid NFT Staking System is an innovative method of staking digital assets that blends the versatility of liquid staking with the potential benefits of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It's a progression from the traditional Liquid Staking System.

Our Staking System is an advancement to the traditional Liquid Staking System.

### **How does it function?**

Users can stake their $COIN or $TOKEN, depending on the network of their choice.

1- When a user intends to stake, they need to connect to the platform and select the preferred network, followed by choosing the desired staking option.

2- The platform will then scrutinize the user's wallet to determine if they already possess a "Vault NFT" (We will discuss the various types of NFTs later). If the user does not have an NFT, the platform will display the following options:

a) Mint a Free Vault NFT (Type 1) \
b) Purchase a Premium Vault NFT (Type 2)

Premium Vault NFT = XDC NFT
{% endhint %}

The differentiation between Free Vault NFT and Premium Vault NFT lies in the following:

**Free Vault NFT**

These NFTs empower users with the ability to stake within the NFT and garner rewards from the nodes of the blockchain that the user is utilizing.\
The user can use one of their favorite NFTs by minting a wrap of their NFT with the Prime Numbers Labs Utility!

Free Vaults Mechanisms work with a $10 activation fee in PRNT.&#x20;

There is no minimum staking amount to receive rewards.
{% endhint %}

**Premium Vault NFT**

These NFTs also allow users to stake within the NFT and receive rewards from the blockchain nodes that the user is employing. Moreover, these NFTs provide additional rewards from the protocols of Prime Numbers Labs such Prime Finance. Premium NFTs fetch higher rewards compared to Free Vault NFTs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The minimum staking amount to receive rewards is 100k XDC tokens.
{% endhint %}

3- Once the user possesses an NFT and is connected to the platform, they can commence staking.

4- The user merely needs to select the NFT, input the staking amount, and they're good to go!

The system provides users with the following options:

In this system, the NFT functions as a vault. Users can stake within the NFT, with the rewards being credited to the NFT. Rewards can be withdrawn from the NFT, and the staked amount can also be retrieved from the NFT.

For instance:

A user stakes 100 ETH within a Vault NFT, then proceeds to Prime Numbers Finance to collateralize the NFT for ETH. This ETH can then be utilized for various purposes such as staking in other NFTs or trading. To reclaim the NFT, the user needs to repay the ETH to Prime Numbers Finance.

This innovative model is the Liquid NFT Staking System. These NFTs are liquid in nature since most of their value is attributed to the amount staked within the NFT.\

**Liquid Staking System Explanation:**\
(This system is used in most of the protocols)\
To understand better how our system operates, let's elucidate the concept of a Liquid Staking System.

Liquid staking represents the latest advancement in staking services. It necessitates users to commit their funds to secure the network, yet retains liquidity, meaning that users maintain access to their resources. Unlike traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, liquid staking sees the funds stored in DeFi escrow accounts, ensuring high liquidity and enabling users to access their tokens at will. With liquid staking, users can unlock multiple revenue streams from their crypto assets, as they can stake their assets and still have them accessible. This liquidity can then be used in other DeFi protocols to garner additional returns on initial deposits.

Liquid staking, despite sharing characteristics with other staking options, employs distinct execution methods. A novel class of protocols, referred to as liquid staking protocols, have been conceived to afford traders the potential to enhance their crypto portfolios. These protocols let users stake any quantity of an asset and unstake them without affecting the initial deposit. In this setup, deposits are secured on liquid staking platforms and users receive a tokenized variant of their crypto assets. This derivative version holds the same value and operates in parity with the original asset, albeit usually pegged with a different symbol for identification.

Take, for instance, a staker who deposits 1 ETH into a liquid staking service and requests a derivative; they will obtain one stETH, with "st" symbolizing staked ETH.

These new tokens can subsequently be transferred from the protocol, stored elsewhere, traded, or spent, all without impacting the initial deposit. The versatility offered by liquid staking services is not their only standout feature. Users can earn staking rewards on their initial deposits while simultaneously generating additional funds from their derivative tokens, making it a mutually beneficial situation. If a staker desires to withdraw their original deposit, they must return a deposit value equivalent to access their funds. Some liquid staking protocols impose a usage fee, although these fees fluctuate.

Liquid staking provides a fresh experience for coin holders, offering an opportunity to leverage their assets for potential growth. Nevertheless, liquid staking takes this a step further. One of the chief advantages of liquid staking is its flexibility. In the face of crypto assets' volatility, locking funds for an extended period may not be financially prudent. As digital currencies are locked, their valuation fluctuates based on the underlying assetâ€™s performance. During a bear market, traditional staking could result in a loss. However, liquid staking allows users to easily withdraw a tokenized version and deposit it in more profitable systems to offset such losses. Another benefit is the provision of multiple income streams. Stakers can lock their funds on one platform and use a tokenized version as collateral to secure crypto-backed loans, which can then be deposited in high-growth accounts, driving higher returns. This makes liquid staking a significant draw for DeFi-focused users.

Like any financial system, liquid staking comes with its own set of drawbacks and risks. One such risk is the potential for the tokenized asset to depeg from the original staked token. For example, the Ethereum network experienced an incident where stETH traded lower than ETH due to an overextended use of the tokenized version, leading to an elastic supply. Another risk is that if a user loses their tokenized asset in a trade, they also forfeit access to their deposited funds. The only method to recover the initial deposit is to make a deposit of equivalent value. Furthermore, as liquid staking operates via smart contracts, it is subject to inherent risks. Although smart contracts are highly efficient, they can also be susceptible to bugs, providing a potential avenue for hackers to siphon off users' funds. In such an event, users could lose all their funds with no recourse for retrieval.

In conclusion, liquid staking represents an advanced staking strategy. It offers a new way for users to utilize their assets for potential growth. Instead of having funds locked without any access, liquid staking provides users with a liquid variant of their assets for use on other platforms. This flexibility, combined with the ability to redeem assets at any point, makes the staking service particularly appealing. However, despite its profitability, liquid staking is a complex strategy and should ideally be employed by experienced stakers.\
