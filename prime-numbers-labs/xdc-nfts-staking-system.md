# XDC NFTs Staking System

In this system, the NFT functions as a vault. Users can stake within the NFT, with the rewards being credited to the NFT. Rewards can be withdrawn from the NFT, and the staked amount can also be retrieved from the NFT.

Through this system, we manage to provide significant benefits to XDC holders interested in staking on nodes, while eliminating entry barriers:&#x20;

* Masternode KYC&#x20;
* 10M XDC tokens

### **How does it function?**

Users can stake their XDC tokens through 2 different NFT collections.

1- When a user intends to stake, they need to connect to the platform, select the XDC network, and choose the staking option.

2- The platform will then scrutinize the user's wallet to determine if they already possess an "XDC NFT" (We will discuss the various types of NFTs later). If the user does not have an NFT, the platform will display the following options:

a) Mint a Free Vault NFT (Type 1) (Not live)\
b) Purchase a Premium Vault NFT (Type 2) (Current XDC NFT staking system)

The differentiation between Free Vault NFT and Premium Vault NFT lies in the following:

**Free Vault NFT**

These NFTs empower users with the ability to stake within the NFT and garner rewards from the nodes of the blockchain that the user is utilizing.\
The user can use one of their favorite NFTs by minting a wrap of their NFT with the Prime Numbers Labs Utility!

Free Vaults Mechanisms work with a $10 activation fee in PRNT.&#x20;

There is no minimum staking amount to receive rewards.
{% endhint %}

**Premium Vault NFT**

These NFTs also allow users to stake within the NFT and receive rewards from the blockchain nodes that the user is employing. Moreover, these NFTs provide additional rewards from the protocols of Prime Numbers Labs, such as Prime Finance. Premium NFTs fetch higher rewards compared to Free Vault NFTs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The minimum staking amount to receive masternode rewards is 100k XDC tokens.
{% endhint %}

3- Once the user possesses an NFT and is connected to the platform, they can commence staking.

4- The user needs to select the NFT, input the staking amount, and they're ready!
