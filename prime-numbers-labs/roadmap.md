# Roadmap

Quick summary of our previous milestones:

Q4 2021: We created Prime Numbers Labs with the original idea. We made token sales to make the project possible, and initial development started.\
\
2022: We hired most of the current team members. We developed the first NFT Marketplace on the XDC Network, Primeport. We partnered with XDC. We released our innovative staking with the PRNT and XDC tokens. In 2022, we learned a lot about business and development, making possible the fantastic growth we achieved in 2023.

2023: We released our new versions of staking, made huge improvements in our current products, and developed Prime Finance, our lending and borrowing protocol.

2024:&#x20;

\
[PRNT Staking V3 & XDC Staking V2:](../prime-numbers-xdc-ecosystem/prime-numbers-staking-design.md) Our new staking version is a massive advance over our previous smart contracts. We made everything ready for our Liquid Staking System.

\
[Staking Interface V3:](https://staking.primenumbers.xyz/) Our new version of the staking interface now provides a lot of data and a user-friendly interface for people looking to stake.

\
Vaults & Liquid Staking XDC NFTs: Thanks to Prime Finance and our staking systems, we will finally be able to release the full version of the staking system.

\
Series A: We are fundraising with equity to put Prime Numbers Labs at the next level.\
\
Prime Finance MVP: The second version of Prime Finance will be the MVP coming to the public. \
\
Obtaining Licenses: During 2024 and 2025, we will do everything to get the required licenses to be fully regulated.

\
Prime Finance NFT compatibility: In this third version of Prime Finance, we will integrate our NFT Staking System. Which will make the % of staked PRNT grow even more.

\
Prime Finance EVMs: We will seek more EVMs to expand our platforms.
